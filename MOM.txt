e M/s TTL engineer Mr.NagababuBathineedireached site on 10.11. 2018 for catrying out TG
set overhauling work. Mr. JyotishmanBhowal reached site on 17-11-2018 for the same.
Fr-14A (38/141)-

¢ All internals cleanup checked and observed not satisfactory from customer end and cleaning
done

e Rotor blades and diaphragm condition checked and no further wear observed on diaphragms
compared to previous conditions.But blades are highly wornout condition (sl No.-38) hence
M/s TTL recommends rotor reblading at TTL works

e Bearings of turbine& gearbox, turbine and alternator checked visually checked and no cracks
observed except light scoring marks, Heavy rubbing observed in alternator NDE bearing.

e DBottom half diaphragms, laby holders with packing, pinion and gearwheel assembled into
turbine and gearbox casings and all checked done as per protocol and recorded. Protocol to be
referred for the same

e Casing studs and cap nuts of both H.T. and L.T. sets observed worn out and needs
replacement. M/s TTL recommends procurement of spare studs and cap nuts for replacement
in next season

e H.P, Interstage and L.P. steam and oil seal laby packing clearances are observed on higher
side sl no. 38 L.T. set and due to non-availability of spares could not be replaced. Hence
customer complaint of steam leakage and condensate in oil issue could not be addressed. M/s
TTL recommends to procure the same for replacement in next overhauling season

e Welding observed in overspeed trip assembly suggesting overspeed trip adjusted to below
design value. Since this was carried out long back, hence not disturbed

e Oil inlet fitting of L.T. turbine observed worn out and due to non-availability of spare could
not be replaced, M/s TTL recommends to keep oil inlet fitting as spare during overhauling |
season for replacement (

e Alternator NDE bearing clearance was observed on higher side with heavy rubbing on
bearings for L.T. set (S1. No.-38). Due to non-availability of spare bearings, could not be
replaced.

e M/s TTL recommends keeping bearings of turbine, gearbox and alternator as spares during
season in case of bearing failure

e Throttle valves of both L.T. set (sl No.-38) and H.T. set (S] No.-141) observed worn out and
could not be replaced due to non-availability of spares & should be replaced in next
overhauling season '

e Actuator drive shaft ball bearings of sl no. — 141 observed worn out and due to non-
availability of spare ball bearings could not be replaced. M/s TTL recommends ball bearing
replacement in next overhauling season

e AOP pump of H.T. turbine of SI No.- 141 observed not developing required pressure for
rolling and hence recommends replacement with new spare. M/s TTL recommends for
procurement the same

e Relay oil cylinder o-rings for both STG needs to be replaced in next season due to their worn
out condition

e M/s TTL observed, TG oil which M/s MRK claims to be ISO VG 68 grade oil which is at
deep red in colour &which is not satisfactory and recommended changing of oil to fresh oil of
grade ISO VG 68 or ISO VG 46. Oil was changed by M/s MRK before re-commissioning,.
However the oil was contaminated and was not satisfactory before start of commissioning
and was checked by M/s TTL. Hence M/s TTL recommends for oil quality test and further
filtration of oil.

e Both STG’s were re-commissioned on 14-12-2018 and all temperature and vibration
parameters observed normal and satisfactory.

e Alternator of Jyoti make L.T. set ( STG Sl No.- 38) moderate vibration observed which got
reduced after loading of STG. M/s TTL recommends alternator re-cantering in next
overhauling season with bearing replacement

e Mechanical over speed trip for both STG observed are as follows:-

o L.T. set (SL. No.-38)- 9730 RPM
o H.T. set (S1. No- 141)- 8750 RPM

e Mechanical overspeed observed on lower side and M/s TTL observed welding in overspeed
trip valves and requests to procure the overspeed trip valves and springs for replacement in
next overhauling season

e During mechanical overspeed trip test of H.T. set (S1. No. 141) M/s TTL observed problems
with woodward 505 electronic governor along with its display system.

e M/s TTL recommends both H.T. and L.T STG governors be checked by M/s TTL electrical
personnel and take his recommendations.

FR-525 M.M. (Sl. no. §5,52,53,75 and 56)

e Gearwheel fore and after bearing of Mill turbine no.-53 (Mill-1) observed in severe rubbed
condition and only gearwheel after bearing with re-white-metalling was available which is
not of good quality. M/s TTL does not recommend the same and will not take responsibility,
if failure of bearing during running.

e Dent marks observed in bearings which was reported earlier and could not be replaced due to
spare shortage. Hence will be replaced in next season

e Cam shaft of Sl. No.-53 Mill-4 observed in worn out condition and moderate damage
observed. M/s TTL recommends replacement in next overhauling season

o Thrust wear trip lock spindle with spring observed worn out and was not functioning
properly. Already lock spindle was changed with spare and tripping was observed working

satisfactory. However lock spindle spring is not functioning correctly and needs to be
replaced on urgent basis for Mill-2 (S1. No.- 75)

e M/s TTL recommends keeping one set of bearings, throttle valves, MOP and PTV valve
spares

e Mill and fibrizer turbines were re-comimissioned on 14-12-2018 and all bearing temperatures
and vibration parameters observed normal and satisfactory. Mechanical overspeed tripping
done and tripping are as follows:-

o Mill-1-7000 RPM
o Mill-2-7000 RPM
Lol ee Pl sl
P W'V\ \ﬂﬁ\}


o Mill-3-7600 RPM
o Mill-4-6900 RPM
o Fibrizer- 7600 RPM
o However M/s TTL observed all speed indicators not calibrated as pet requirement and RPM
output from tacho-generators had to be checked using multimeter and calculations and about
200 - 500 RPM difference was observed between speed indicators of field and panel reading.
Hence calibration done by M/s MRK of the speed instruments is not upto the mark. M/s TTL
recommends re-calibration of all RPM instruments and notifies the RPM difference between
multimeter and speed indicators should not be more than 50 RPM.
Further note:—
o M/s TTL requests M/s MRK to-fix all steam line leakages properly without fail and all steam
drains should be vented out of the plant
e M/s TTL engineers left site on 15-12-2018
